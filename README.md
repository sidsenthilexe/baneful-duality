Your goal is to deliver the cure to a zombie virus that is ravaging the world to the Pentagon.

However, while you want to travel peacefully, as you know that the zombies that oppose you can be cured,

your alter ego forces you to do whatever it takes to achieve your goal as fast as possible.

You are in control but you can't make the choices you would like to.
